## Install

After installing [Node](http://nodejs.org) on your development environment, you can install all the dependencies necessary for this project with a single command.

```
{~/path/to/project/folder}
npm install
```

## Run local server

Once the project dependencies have been installed, another one-liner will compile the stylesheets and start up a local server with livereload enabled (stylesheets only).

```
{~/path/to/project/folder}
gulp serve
```

Then, go to the address indicated in the green console output, e.g. http://localhost:8080.  Any changes to the stylesheets or templates within the project will reload the appropriate page resources without having to refresh the page.
